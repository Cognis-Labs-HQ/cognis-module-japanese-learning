# Cognis Japanese

**English** · [Deutsch](README.de.md) · [Bahasa Indonesia](README.id.md) · [日本語](README.ja.md)

Cognis Japanese is a declarative Japanese content pack for the Cognis Study Library. It provides a versioned schema and validated character, definition, word, particle, and sentence records without owning API routes, persistence, or browser interfaces.

## Requirements

- Cognis with the Study gateway and Library adapter enabled.
- The `study:library` host capability.

The external module declares the Study gateway as its component dependency. It discovers the Library adapter through the required `study:library` capability rather than treating the adapter UUID as an independently installable component.

## Development

```sh
npm install
npm test
npm run check:manifest
```

During bootstrap, the module obtains `study:library` through `ctx` and calls `ingestContentPack` for `data/library`. Cognis owns path safety, graph validation, stable internal IDs, transactions, idempotency, persistence, API routes, and schema-generated Study interfaces.

Because the language descriptor declares no executable child pages, Cognis Study supplies the generated Library destination at `/study/library?language=ja`. The validated language query remains attached to Library links, detail navigation, direct loads, and browser history; authenticated learners may browse while Library scope rules continue to protect authoring and publishing.

The content-pack manifest records its publisher, immutable package version, content revision, schema and content paths, and license. `schema.json` declares Japanese-specific layers, typed fields, relationships, cardinality, ordering, and resolvers. Content files use stable pack-local IDs and explicit references.

Pack-local record IDs use only portable lowercase ASCII letters, numbers, separators, and colons; Japanese glyphs belong in `label`, never in `id`. This keeps ingestion compatible with the Library content-record identifier contract.

The schema and pack share the `ja` namespace, and every record ID begins with `ja:`. Schema, layer, field, and relationship metadata provide localized labels in German, English, Indonesian, and Japanese. Semantic roles, typed values, detail hints, activity compatibility, interest veins, required targets, ordered positions, deletion behavior, and resolver roles allow Cognis to generate neutral interfaces and enforce the complete contract.

The external module manifest publishes `/static/modules/study-language-ja/languages` so Cognis can translate marketplace metadata before module bootstrap.

The published language descriptor provides the canonical `code` value `ja` as well as the compatible `languageCode` value. Cognis PR #215 uses that code to annotate the active language button and preserve the selected language in router history when a Study sub-navigation destination is opened.

The `definitions` dictionary layer declares module-owned definition localization with stable `japanese:definitions:*` string keys and a typed `localizedText` field. Every preseeded definition includes German, English, Indonesian, and Japanese text, so consumers resolve display strings without depending on Cognis core language data.

## Writing-unit audio and particles

Atomic and compound writing units now provide required pronunciation lists and HTTPS audio references without packaging binary media. The dedicated particle layer stores grammatical function metadata, and sentence records can preserve ordered word and particle references.

## Library-native meanings

Removed duplicate `romanization`, `reading`, `readings`, `meaning`, `function`, and definition-language fields. Pronunciation now consistently uses the Library-recognized `pronunciation` field, while kanji, words, and particles express meanings through relationships to localized definition records.

## Kana-backed kanji readings

Each kanji reading is a distinct vocabulary record whose ordered `kana-spelling` references group its exact hiragana characters. Kanji link to those reading records in pronunciation order, so multi-kana readings remain separate from one another. Katakana characters retain separate IDs and links and remain available for genuinely katakana content.

## Current Library activation contract

Character-script and JLPT badge filters now declare named, mutually exclusive filter groups supported by Library 2.6. The module intentionally does not enable `allowBootstrapFailure`: content ingestion and publication of `study:language:ja` are its essential runtime work, and keeping it enabled without them would expose a nonfunctional module. Cognis PR #216 now updates existing entries, assets, and references during repeated content-pack imports, which addresses the reported duplicate-reference failure at its persistence boundary.

## Directional tenten variants

Only dakuten (tenten) forms use the directional parent/child relationship. The seeded `じ`/`ご` and `ジ`/`ゴ` records reference `し`/`こ` and `シ`/`コ` respectively within their own character table. Hiragana and katakana counterparts remain independent records and are not modeled as parent and child.

## Latest Library presentation contract

Directional tenten links no longer declare a resolver role, so the Library uses them only to unfold child cards and does not duplicate the parent as a constituent box. Kanji reading and word spelling relationships retain resolver roles for navigable constituents. The current Library places writing-unit pronunciation beside labels in cards and detail titles, and restores missing module content on the next enable unless a user explicitly blacklists its content hash.

## Compositions and definitions

Resolver roles are now reserved for true compositions: kanji readings, word spellings, and ordered sentence words or particles. Relationships to the semantic definition layer no longer declare a resolver, so primary and alternate definition links render as meanings instead of composition groups. Required writing-system and proficiency filters also declare intentional default tags for the latest Library filter contract.

## Complete kana tables

The content pack now includes all 46 basic gojūon entries in both hiragana and katakana, plus every standard dakuten and handakuten form. Each of the 25 voiced or semi-voiced children per script links to its unmarked parent in the same character table, including `が` → `か`, `じ` → `し`, `ぱ` → `は` and their katakana equivalents.

## Distinct diacritic placement

Both relationships explicitly declare `variant: true`, as required whenever `variantDirection` is present. Dakuten children use the `dakuten-of` relationship and unfold to the right of their unmarked parent. Handakuten children use `handakuten-of` and unfold to its left, so parents such as `は` and `ハ` visibly retain both variants instead of stacking them in one position.

## Standard kana grid

The character layer requests a five-card row and lists both scripts in standard gojūon order. The grid contains only base-kana records, while dakuten and handakuten remain directional children around their unmarked parent.

## Definition-backed cards

Aligned with the latest Library presentation contract: words, particles, and sentences now request localized definition-backed card text and every such entry has a required definition reference.

## Japanese-specific layer labels

The generated Library tabs now use module-owned subject labels: Kana for atomic characters, Kanji for compound writing units, and Vocabulary for words. Kanji readings target grouped vocabulary records rather than a flattened run of character references.

## Filter-safe kana ordering

Removed unconditional blank placeholders between the hiragana and katakana sequences. When the writing-system filter hides one script, the selected table now begins in the first grid cell instead of inheriting blank cells from the hidden table.

## Compact Kana cards

Only the Kana character layer sets `minimal: true`, so the chart renders compact cards containing the primary kana label. Kanji, Vocabulary, and Sentences retain their full pronunciation, definition, metadata, and composition presentation.
