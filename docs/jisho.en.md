# Complete Jisho results

The Jisho provider now returns every reading with ordered Kana groups, a separate importable definition for each sense, lexical classification, JLPT/common-word tags, and its source URL. It declares the dictionary capability through `study:library:provider` registration. Full source records—including alternate forms, parts of speech, sense notes, restrictions, dialects, related terms, and attribution—are retained as JSON in the optional hidden `dictionary_data` schema field.

## Usage

Cognis PR #226 supplies the common result preview, definition import, and missing-language translation action. Providers supply authentic source translations; Cognis requests German, English, Indonesian, and Japanese through its optional localization capability. The module does not invent translations or copy English into other languages. Native content lookup still precedes the network and now preserves class and tags.

## Technical specification

Schema revision 88 and module/content-pack version 2.2.84 publish the source-data field. Import all returned senses through the host preview, or choose a subset within the host definition limit; the complete original result remains stored regardless of which senses are linked.

## Dedicated Kanji lookup

Kanji outside the bundled content now use Jisho’s dedicated Kanji page instead of its lexical word API. The provider imports Kun/On readings, meanings, stroke count, grade, JLPT level, and frequency. Reading separators are removed for pronunciation while source notation remains in dictionary_data. Upstream failures report a lookup error instead of an empty result. The KanjiVG provider explicitly declares its stroke-pattern capability and field. Module/content-pack version 2.2.85 keeps schema revision 88.

## Identified Jisho requests

Jisho Kanji and word requests now send a descriptive Cognis User-Agent. This resolves HTTP 403 responses observed with Node’s default request identity, including lookup of 教. Failure logs include a safe failure code and HTTP status when available, separating upstream rejection, invalid response format, and transport failure without recording response bodies. Module/content-pack version 2.2.86 retains schema revision 88.

## Hidden dictionary provenance

Jisho suggestions now store their exact source URL inside the hidden dictionary_data field alongside the complete source record. Cognis imports this metadata directly while omitting visible source links and the result popup. Module/content-pack version 2.2.87 retains schema revision 88.
